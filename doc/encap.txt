ENCAP DEFINITION
----------------

Preamble
--------

This document defines the specification for the ENCAP command.

ENCAP is designed to help fix the situation where new commands do
not propagate over hub servers running older code.

Definition
----------

Support for the ENCAP command is given by the CAPAB token "ENCAP".

The format of ENCAP is:
  :<source> ENCAP <destination> <subcommand> <parameters>

<source>        - The entity generating the command.

<destination>   - The entity the command is destined for.  This may
                  include wildcards for servers, but not clients.

                  If the wildcard does not match the current server, the 
                  command should be propagated and ignored.

<subcommand>    - The subcommand we're propagating over ENCAP.  If the
                  subcommand is not recognised by the current server, the
                  command should be propagated and ignored.

<parameters>    - The parameters that the subcommand have.
