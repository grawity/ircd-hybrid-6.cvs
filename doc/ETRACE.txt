ETRACE Protocol (by W. Campbell)

ETRACE is used to provide monitor bots with all of the information they
should need, including GECOS data (which is absent from a standard TRACE).

The ETRACE command is only available to local opered connections.  The
command takes no parameters.

ETRACE will retun the following numerics:

:<source> 709 <dest> <status> <class> <nick> <username> <host> <ip> :<gecos>

Where the <status> field is "Oper" or "User"
and the <ip> field is "255.255.255.255" for a spoofed connection.

:<source> 262 <dest> <source> :End of TRACE
